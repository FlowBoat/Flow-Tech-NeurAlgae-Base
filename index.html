                <p>Algal blooms, the sudden and rapid reproduction of microscopic algae or cyanobacteria in water bodies, have recently become a serious ecological issue threatening both the vitality of their local ecosystems and the socioeconomic conditions
                    of their affected areas. Many of these algal blooms are caused by eutrophication (excesses of nutrients in the water), often due to local farm fertilizer runoff, have the potential to engulf entire coastal regions. These enormous blooms
                    deplete sunlight in the area, as well as absorbing large quantities of dissolved oxygen when they decay, depriving the local aquatic ecosystems of vital resources and causing them to collapse into dead zones. In addition, the algae
                    within these blooms often produce toxic chemicals as by-products of their metabolism. </p>
                <p>These algal blooms, known as Harmful Algal Blooms or HABs, are becoming increasingly prevalent in today's society with the advent of modern agricultural techniques without sufficiently sophisticated environmental precautions to match.
                    If the presence of algal blooms could be predicted, recovery efforts could be optimized to coincide with the algal blooms' initial outbreak, minimizing both the ecological and socioeconomic costs of the blooming. Even as the world
                    of real-time oceanographic monitoring systems becomes more accessible and descriptive, early response efforts are still limited by the scope of the knowledge that these systems provide them; specifically, by the fact that the information
                    that these systems provide is real-time at best and at worst, abandoned. Therefore a more elegant and efficient solution must be proposed.</p>
                <p>Machine learning is the very field of computer science that is developed enough to provide such a solution. This field teaches computers to “learn” by subjecting them to a matrix of input data, encouraging it to make correlations between
                    those inputs and predetermined outputs. By doing so, computers are able to understand, manipulate and create relationships between data that would otherwise be incomprehensible to humans. In this way, a computer could identify the
                    direct relationship between the environmental factors affecting a body of water and the possibility of a harmful algal bloom occurring there.</p>

                <p>The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s (NOAA’s) OPENDAP database contains a plethora of location tagged oceanographic data freely accessible through there ERDDAP server. When combined with NASA and CENCOOS’ algal bloom realtime

                <h3>Abstract</h3>
                <p>Algal blooms, the sudden reproduction of microscopic algae or cyanobacteria in water bodies, have recently become a serious ecological issue. These algal blooms, caused by eutrophican, often due to fertilizer runoff, can deplete local
                    sunlight, absorb dissolved oxygen, and produce toxic chemicals. Because of modern agricultural techniques, HABs are rapidly becoming a large ecological and economic issue. To counter this problem, we propose a method of implementing
                    machine learning to predict the occurence of HABs using oceanographic data. We used an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to correlate water measurements and the probabilities of finding three HAB indicators (Pseudo-Nitzschia cells, cellular
                    domoic acid, and particulate domoic acid) above certain threshold values, producing an accurate predictive model.</p>
                <h3>Purpose</h3>
                <p>The purpose of this project is to develop an Artificial Neural Network which can effectively predict the probability of a Harmful Algal Bloom event occurring in an arbitrary location, given certain data about the water in the region. By
                    training the network, a model will be produced with the network's final sets of weights and biases of the network, which can be used to quickly forward any input data to receive ouptput data.</p>
                <h3>Design Criteria</h3>
                <p>The program mus be able to retrieve sequential marine environment data from a NOAA OPENDAP database, update and train itself in realtime, accurately deterimine the probability of: harmful abundances of high toxicity, domoic acid carrying
                    algae species. Also the web app should facilitate the easy access to the NeurAlgae prediction algorithm for the lay person, in order to increase the response time of municipal utility agencies.</p>
                <h3>Design Method and Challenges</h3>
                <p>The primary difficulty in implementing an ANN-based solution to this problem was not the creation of any network by itself, but rather the decision of how to design the network in order to optimize its effectiveness without encountering
                    any of the many difficulties associated with machine-learning optimization problems. After experimenting with many different possible ANN varieties, including various activation functions, cost functions, optimization methods, regularization
                    methods, etc. the final design of the ANN made use of entirely sigmoid neurons, the cross-entropy cost function, stochastic gradient descent optimization using back-propagation, and L2 regularization. Another difficulty encountered
                    was the scarcity of complete data to train the network with, which was fully supervised.</p>

                <span class="image main"><img src="images/pic07.jpg" alt="" /></span>
                <h3>Use of Sequential Data Analysis to Improve Generalization</h3>
                <p>An important distinction between this approach and other possible models is the consideration of adjacent data points in the training of the next in a sequential dataset. By examining the probability of neighboring data points in a linear
                    sequential set, the computer is able to retrieve and learn from the probability of an algal bloom from the last timestamp. This results in the network behaving recurrently; that is, the network is able to pass its outputs into its
                    next input matrix, allowing a limited capacity for simulated memory.</p>
                <span class="image main"><img src="images/pic05.jpg" alt=""></span>
                <span class="image main"><img src="images/pic06.jpg" alt=""></span>
                <p>Using this pseudo-recurrence in a deep neural network, the computer is able to make far more accurate predictions. If the lay user inputs a sequential data series for a given monitoring station, the neural network is able to use historical
                    forecast data to increase its accuracy and make more precise predictions for the given data series. As shown in the figure above the number of false positives decreases overtime as the network is able to learn from its own behaviour
                    and forecast accuracy.</p>

                <!--<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic03.jpg" alt="" /></span>-->
                <h3>Results and analysis</h3>
                <p>Our neural network model was used to build four separate networks, nn30, nn30r, nn5050, and nn5050r. The networks marked '30' had 30 hidden nodes in one hidden layer, and the '5050' networks had 100 hidden nodes evenly in two hidden layers.
                    The networks without the letter 'r' took our 10 pieces of input data, while the 'r' networks took that and three pieces of past output data, allowing for pseudo-recurrence. The networks were created and trained using two thirds of
                    our dataset, and tested using the remaining third. We used validation techniques to choose the same learning rate and regularization parameters for each network. All four networks trained differently, but they all trained well without
                    overfitting. Each network's error values (the average differences between the network outputs and the output data) went down by orders of magnitude before the cost function minimized.</p>

                <hr>
                <p>When given input data, the trained networks gave output values which were not exactly the same as the given algal bloom probabilities, but were in a close range - which is the optimal result for this problem, since the empirical data can
                    vary so much, a fairly wide margin to account for differences is necessary in the model to prevent overfitting, and yet the model still is able to produce output data that is accurate enough to give a good idea of the algal bloom chances
                    in that region.</p>
                <h3>Conclusion</h3>
                <p>Our program meets its design criteria by accurately and efficiently predicting the probability of HAB events to within a reasonable error margin. While, of course, the fit of the network is somewhat imprecise, to fit much more would result
                    in overfitting of the empirical and somewhat noisy data. Meanwhile, the output values given are close enough to expected output values that they could be used for the prediction of HABs - not in precise quantities, which is nearly
                    impossible given the complexity of ocean ecosystems, but with enough precision to accurately determine data quickly for a given location, give an estimate of its severity, and allow humans to respond accordingly. Since our prediction
                    takes in 10 data values, it is already an improvement over human methods, since human brains cannot keep track of complex 10-parameter models in their heads.</p>
                <h3>Next steps</h3>
                <p>While the progam could not train further using the methods outlined here, there are ways to improve its performance. Most oceanographic data does not measure a complete set of data for our model, and historical data is often limited, so
                    our datasets were on the small side. Much more data would result in a more accurately trained network. Additionally, one of the largest improvements our model could use would be to transition to fully-recurrent networks. These networks
                    are more complicated and would allow our model to better compute the correlations. Finally, our model currently uses inputs of oceanographic data, but if satellite data could be given as a secondary input source, and the network given
                    a classification task, our accuracy could be improved, perhaps even to rival the C-HARM model we used to obtain our datasets (although this would sacrifice some computational efficiency).
